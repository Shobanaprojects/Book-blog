        description: "I found out about this book from another one I read called The Psychology of Money. The title caught my attention, especially since I'm someone who enjoys alone time and is always pressed for time. I often wish there were more hours in a day. Even though I already know a few things about the topic, this book surprised me with some new insights. Only when you learn to love solitude, will you be able to do everything on your own that you expect from people to do for/with you. Romanticising your life means becoming the main character of your life as if your entire day is being recorded. You rely your hope on someone who doesn’t exist. And that’s why, when things don’t fall as per your imagination, you start feeling even more lonely as if you had something but you lost it. Loneliness is not when you don’t have people around. Loneliness occurs when you cannot find yourself inside you. The moment you feel the loss of your real self, that’s when loneliness makes a home inside you. Self-love is about knowing everything about yourself, however ugly or dark or bad your truth is, and accepting yourself with it. People aren’t ambulances who can be available to you whenever you want. They have got their own shit to deal with. You cannot expect people to stay forever. You will have to create enough space within your own heart for yourself so that being with yourself feels safe. And being with people is like a bonus, not a short-term pleasure or escape. View your loneliness as a privilege and not as a curse. The catch is to focus on one thing at a time. Choose the one biggest issue you are facing in your life right now. What is the one thing which keeps pulling you down?",

        title: "Wolf Totem",
        description: "I read this book 9 months ago, after having my head buried in it for 4 days and I still can’t stop thinking about it. It is the most wonderful book and is quite possibly now my favourite book of all time. From the very first page I was hooked. Jiang Rong creates such a vivid and compelling narrative that I found myself similtaniously gripped with the story yet trying to slow down and savour every word, so beautiful was each sentence. Wolf Totem is semi-autobiographical and Jiang’s passion for the Mongolian grasslands shines through on every page. The description of the grasslands themselves, the wildlife, the lifestyle and survival was stunning. So few books make me believe that I am there at the actual place, but with this book I was there on horseback, hiding from wolves, fleeing for my life, braving blizzards and building campfires. I smiled, I cried, I hoped and I silently pleaded all within the space of an hour. I also fell in love with wild Mongolian wolves. To get to know them was a pleasure – they are clever, cunning, brave, brilliant and I loved following their story (from both sides – the good and the bad). The Little Wolf that was captured and raised by humans both endeared me and broke my heart. While this book is most certainly a tale of the grasslands of the last 10,000 years and what happens when modern living creeps in, it is also a book about so much more. I can’t praise this enough; I am sad that it has ended as I could have read on for another 500 pages. What a beautiful book, one I highly recommend and one I will be reading again and again.",

        title: "The Alchemist",
        description: "Early this week, I have finished reading the book “The Alchemist.” I have been hearing about this book forever, and something compelled me to get the book two weeks ago and start reading it. I really loved the book; it was a spiritual experience and awakening once again. As one of the most spiritually influential authors of the modern era, Paulo Coelho has penned numerous works that have transformed the perspectives and lives of thousands worldwide. “The Alchemist” is a short novel about listening to our hearts and following our dreams. It conveys universal truths embraced by the spiritual, told through the story of a young shepherd boy, Santiago, who leaves his flock and family in Spain to seek treasure at the pyramids of Egypt. Along his journey, he encounters a king with the transformative power and magical stones of the Old Testament, an Arab merchant yearning for pilgrimage, a desert woman with whom he falls in love, and an alchemist who teaches him to follow his heart. “The Alchemist” surely resonates most with those who enjoy contemplating ideas about universal oneness, spiritual journeys, and the Language of the World, and is best read with an open mind to such lofty concepts. I wish I had read this book when I was a lot younger so that I could have gone on more adventures and followed my dream a little harder. Here are the top 10 learnings and takeaways from “The Alchemist”.",
